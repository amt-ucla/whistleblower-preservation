						<section data-auto-animate><h3>Professional Ethics and Responsibility</h3>
							<p>The Society for American Archives does not provide direct instructions on the handling and ethics of whistleblower disclosures and leaked documents, however members can look for some guidance in the <a href="https://www2.archivists.org/statements/saa-core-values-statement-and-code-of-ethics">SAA Core Values Statement and Code of Ethics</a></p>
						</section>
						<section data-auto-animate><h3>Professional Ethics and Responsibility</h3>
							<p>In particular, archivists can look to the following for guidance</p>
						</section>
						<section data-auto-animate><h3>Professional Ethics and Responsibility</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>Develop and follow professional standards that promote transparency and mitigate harm.</li>
								<li>As responsible stewards, archivists commit to making ethical and transparent decisions about how to provide care for the documents, records, and materials entrusted to them.</li>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h3>SAA's Code of Ethics Statement on Privacy</h3>
							<p class="r-fit-text">Archivists recognize that privacy is an inherent fundamental right and sanctioned by law. They establish procedures and policies to protect the interests of the donors, individuals, groups, and organizations whose public and private lives and activities are documented in archival holdings. As appropriate and mandated by law, archivists place access restrictions on collections to ensure that privacy and confidentiality are maintained, particularly for individuals and groups who have had no voice or role in collections’ creation, retention, or public use. Archivists should maintain transparency when placing these restrictions, documenting why and for how long they will be enacted. Archivists promote the respectful use of culturally sensitive materials in their care by encouraging researchers to consult with those represented by records, recognizing that privacy has both legal and cultural dimensions. Archivists respect all users’ rights to privacy by maintaining the confidentiality of their research and protecting any personal information collected about the users in accordance with their institutions’ policies.
